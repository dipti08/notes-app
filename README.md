This is a basic beginner level node.js project which helps in clearing various concepts of node.js . This project is a small notes app which helps the users to add new notes along with their title and content. It also helps the users to read the various notes already written and delete a note if he/she wants to. Also, the app takes care of duplicacy and does not allow uploading a note with the same title. It also helps in getting to know about the JSON language and how to deal with an object and convert it to string to read and vice versa.
